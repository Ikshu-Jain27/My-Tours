## My Tours
<br>
It is a beautiful website displaying all the tours. It reflects the amount of money required for making the tour. The website allows the user to sort the tours based on his interest by allowing him to mark places which he is not interested in visiting by clicking the <b>Not Interested</b> button.
<br>
In case all the tours have been marked as <b>Not Interested</b> by a person then it displays <b>No Tours Left</b>. This is accompanied by the <b>Refresh button</b> to display the entire list of tours again.
