## My Tours
<br/>
It is a beautiful website displaying all the tours. It reflects the amount of money required for making the tour. The website allows the user to sort the tours based on his interest by allowing him to mark places which he is not interested in visiting by clicking the <b>Not Interested</b> button.

<br/>
It is user friendly and allows the user to read more or read less before their fingers start aching due to excessive scrolling. It also helps avoid unnecessary go through the content of places the user is not interested in.

<br/>
In case all the tours have been marked as <b>Not Interested</b> by a person then it displays <b>No Tours Left</b>. This is accompanied by the <b>Refresh button</b> to display the entire list of tours again.
